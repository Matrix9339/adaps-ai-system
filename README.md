##ADAPS – Autonomous Disruption-Aware Production Planning System

ADAPS is an AI-powered production planning and intelligent decision support system designed to predict operational disruptions and assist in optimizing production workflows. The system uses machine learning and intelligent analysis to identify risks, improve efficiency, and support proactive planning in production and supply chain environments.

##Overview

Production and supply chain operations are often affected by disruptions such as delays, demand changes, and operational inefficiencies. ADAPS addresses this challenge by building an intelligent system capable of predicting disruptions and providing decision support to improve planning and operational efficiency.

This project demonstrates the real-world application of Artificial Intelligence in intelligent production planning systems.
